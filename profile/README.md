# Kosmic ðŸš€ðŸŒ 

Kosmic is a TypeScript first server framework that focuses on simplicity, speed, and type experience, all based on the amazing koa framework.

Disclaimer: While most of Kosmic's drop in replacements are completely production safe and ready, deep and full type compatibility with the Koa eco system at large is still a challenge. If you use @kosmic/koa or @kosmic middlewares and are experiencing type compatibility issues with the koa's third party types, leave an issue and we will work on solutions or replacements for incompatible modules.
